Hey! I'm a {Math.floor((Date.now() - new Date(2008, 1, 28).getTime()) / 86_400_000 / 365)}-year old student who has a
passion for software development and computer science. I created this portfolio as a way to showcase and elaborate on my
projects and accomplishments.

I'm currently working on a few projects, including [the Terbium Programming Language](/projects/terbium),
[the Adapt chat platform](/projects/adapt), and [RIL, an image processing library for Rust](/projects/ril).
You can view almost all of my projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jay3332). I typically open-source
my work and make it available for others to use and contribute to.

## My Stack

#### Languages

I primarily program in <span class="font-medium text-[#dea584]">Rust</span>,
<span class="font-medium text-[#3572a5]">Python</span>, and
<span class="font-medium text-[#a97bff]">Kotlin</span> when dealing with systems programming and backend development.
I also use
<span class="font-medium text-[#aaaaaa]">C</span>/<span class="font-medium text-[#f34b7d]">C++</span> for competitive
programming and native bindings with Rust.

#### Data Management

**PostgreSQL** is my go-to database for relational data storage, while **Redis** is used for caching and session
management. I also use **RabbitMQ** as a way to pass messages and events between microservices.

#### Web Development

When developing websites, I use <span class="font-medium text-[#3178c6]">TypeScript</span> with frameworks such as
**Astro** (like this website), **Solid.js**, and **React**. Sometimes, I may also integrate my Rust projects into my
websites using **WebAssembly**. For styling, I primarily use **TailwindCSS** and **Sass**.
